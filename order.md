### Learn about your roast
<blockquote>
{% include roast-finder.html %}
<p>All roast are numbered and have a dedicated page with details about the applied process and roast parameters. The idea is to empower you to learn more about your coffee by understanding for the process and its implications.</p>
</blockquote>

### Get coffee

Limited sample batches are available from time to time.  

If you do your own home roasting, I would to love exchange samples and experiences with you.

I can't guarantee availability. But if you'd like to reserve a roast or do a sample exchange please get in touch via <a href="mailto:hello@plontsch.de">mail</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/berndplontsch">twitter</a>.

Thank you.
