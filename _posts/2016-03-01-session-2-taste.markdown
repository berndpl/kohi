### [Roast #4]({{ site.baseurl }}/4/) ğŸ’€

Too dark. Burnt. Basically undrinkable as a black coffee.

### [Roast #5]({{ site.baseurl }}/5/) ğŸ˜’

Overall too and smokey. Surprisingly oily.

### [Roast #6]({{ site.baseurl }}/6/) ğŸ™„

Beans looked promising being on the lighter end. Taste is a uneven. A bit on the sour end.

### Summary

Waiting for the second crack to not is as a reference time turned out to be useless. I didn't even get to a second crack in this session. Furthermore any roast being beyond 5-8 minutes from the first crack ended up being too dark or burnt to drink black. For now I will disregard the second crack as reference and only focus on the period after the first crack, minute by minute.
