Researched packaging. Found the  [610v](http://www.daklapack.de/laminated-packaging/standbodenbeutel-fur-kaffee/lamizip-kraftpapier-vmpet-150ml-mit-ventil/8712963016500/) (v as for "with valve") One roasting batch in the popcorn popper will result in **60-75g** of beans. So the 150ml will be too much but it's the smallest appropriate packaging I could find. It also has a valve and can be sealed.

Ordered 2 samples.
