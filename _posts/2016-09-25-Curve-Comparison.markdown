Here's a first attempt of comparing roast curves from [Session 5]({{ site.baseurl }}/session-5/). You can also see how the starting temperature is increasing form roast to roast as the popcorn popper isn't fully cooling down.

### [Roast #13]({{ site.baseurl }}/13/)

Too dark, but drinkable

### [Roast #14]({{ site.baseurl }}/14/)

Bitter

### [Roast #15]({{ site.baseurl }}/15/)

Oops. Forgot
