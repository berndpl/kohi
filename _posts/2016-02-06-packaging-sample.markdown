Received samples of the **610V** packaging. Apparantly 150ml is much smaller than expected. But it nicely fits enough beans for a single pour over, around **25g**. Nice for trials.

![Packaging sample]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016-02-06/packaging_sample.jpg)*25g of beans. Packed package with 25g of beans. Empty package*
