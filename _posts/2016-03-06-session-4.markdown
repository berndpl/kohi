With the last roast I finished my first 1kg package of Costa Rica beans. Switching to Guatemala now, another 1kg. 

Unfortunatelly with this I am loosing some abililty to reference learnings but I am curious and excited how much the result will be impacted.

### Plan
> * Further increase weight <strike>from 75g to 90g to 110g</strike> to 120g

### Goals
> * Roast in 1 minute increments after first crack
> * Avoid burned roasts by further narrowing down roast times. Focussing on the first 3 minutes after the first crack. 
> * Trying to achieve a more even roast by increasing the amount of beans (this might also make it all worse)

### Parameters
> * **Origin** Guatemala, Finca Buena Vista, Genuine Antigua, Microlot
> * **Beans** 120g unroasted
> * **Air** 14-16 °C
> * **Duration** First crack + 1-3 minutes
