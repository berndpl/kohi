I finished my first 1kg from Costa Rica. I am switching now to beans from Guatemala. Thereby I am loosing my reference. Everything might change.

### Plan
> * Further increase weight <strike>from 75g to 90g to 110g</strike> to 120g

### Goals
> * Roast in 1 minute increments after first crack
> * Try to get around the one burned roast on the upper end by narrowing the roast times
> * Try to achieve a more even roast by increasing the amount of beans (this might also make it worse)

### Parameters
> * **Origin** Guatemala, Finca Buena Vista, Genuine Antigua, Microlot
> * **Bean weight** 120g unroasted
> * **Air temperature** 14-16 °C
