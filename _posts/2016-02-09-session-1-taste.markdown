### [Roast #1]({{ site.baseurl }}/1/) ☹️

Too dark. Too smokey. Not burned but very much like classic Supermarket coffee beans.

### [Roast #2]({{ site.baseurl }}/2/) 😒

Overall too and smokey. Surprisingly oily.

### [Roast #3]({{ site.baseurl }}/3/) 😝

Too uneven, Sour, unbalanced. Tough but Drinkable

### Summary

Next I'll focus on exploring the area right after the first crack. Trying to  change the roast temperature by increasing the bean amount. Trying to make the short roast more even and balanced. Timing the roast ending not too close after the first crack (~ +3min) to ensure sufficient roast.
